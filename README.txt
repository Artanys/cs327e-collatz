Comments: Program itself did not take very long at all to write. Most of my time was spent figuring out Github and trying to get my UTCS accound activated on the linux machines. I used Visual Studio 2012 and their Python add-in to write my code, as well as conduct profiling during execution. Fastest time was 2.36 on Sphere, which was strangely before the added performance improvements. Perhaps my improvements, which added .06 seconds to the time, are only noticed when the inputs to the program overlap (e.g. "1000 10000\n5000 10000\n").

Code of Conduct
---------------

I attest that I have written every line of code that I have submitted
and I take full responsibility for the origin of all the code submitted.
In particular, if any of the code was originally written in a previous
semester or another course I will so acknowledge via e-mail to the
grader.
